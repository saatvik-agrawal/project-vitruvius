# Future Plans
### **Future Plans Brief for Participatory Design Toolkit**

#### **Overview**

The Participatory Design Toolkit currently recommends workshop templates based on **level of engagement** and **scale of participation**. While this system provides structured recommendations, future enhancements can make the toolkit **more flexible, user-centric, and scalable**.

---

### **Proposed Enhancements**

#### **1️⃣ Expand Selection Criteria**

Currently, the recommendations are based on **Engagement Level** and **Participation Scale**. We could introduce **additional filtering options** such as:

- **Target Audience** – Students, Professionals, Community Members.
- **Workshop Format** – Online, In-Person, Hybrid.
- **Workshop Complexity** – Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.

**📌 Benefit**: Allows users to refine recommendations to better fit their needs.

#### **2️⃣ Advanced Search & Filtering**

Instead of selecting from predefined dropdowns, users could:

- **Search by keywords** (e.g., "community engagement," "design thinking").
- **Filter results dynamically** based on selected criteria.
- **Sort workshops by relevance** (e.g., most interactive, most structured).

**📌 Benefit**: Provides a **customized** experience tailored to unique workshop goals.

---

#### **3️⃣ AI-Powered Workshop Suggestions**

By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the system can:

- Provide **personalized recommendations** based on past selections.
- **Predict relevant workshops** for different project types.
- Allow users to **rate workshops**, improving future suggestions.

**📌 Benefit**: Enhances **usability** with AI-driven insights.

---

#### **4️⃣ Multi-Page Workshop Descriptions**

Each workshop could have:

- A **dedicated page** with **detailed objectives, setup instructions, and downloadable materials**.
- A **preview feature** before users finalize their selection.
- **Integration with external resources** for further learning.

**📌 Benefit**: Creates a **centralized knowledge hub** for workshop planning.
