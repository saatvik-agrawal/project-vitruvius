    <h1>Sandbox Modeling Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop engages participants in hands-on modeling activities using sandbox techniques to explore spatial design, planning concepts, and environmental interactions.</p>
    
    <h2>What Youâ€™ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sandbox or large trays filled with sand</li>
        <li>Miniature objects such as trees, buildings, and vehicles</li>
        <li>Sticks, rulers, or other tools for shaping the sand</li>
        <li>Reference images for inspiration</li>
        <li>Facilitator to guide discussions and encourage creativity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the purpose of sandbox modeling and how it aids in visualizing and experimenting with design ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario Definition:</strong> Participants define the scenario or theme they want to model, such as urban design, landscape planning, or disaster response.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Creation:</strong> Participants use the sandbox and miniature objects to build their models, experimenting with different layouts and configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis and Discussion:</strong> Groups analyze their models, discussing spatial relationships, challenges, and potential improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration and Refinement:</strong> Based on feedback, participants refine their models, making adjustments to improve functionality or representation.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Each group presents their final models and explains their design choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Conclude with a discussion on the applications of sandbox modeling in real-world problem-solving.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage hands-on experimentation with different model configurations.</li>
        <li>Use diverse materials to create varied textures and elements in the sandbox.</li>
        <li>Facilitate discussions to draw connections between models and real-world challenges.</li>
        <li>Document and photograph final models for future reference.</li>
    </ul>
