    <h1>Picturization Exercise Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop helps participants visualize ideas and concepts using symbols and pictorial representations. By engaging in a structured exercise, participants can better communicate thoughts and priorities regarding community planning and design.</p>
    
    <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A selection of symbols representing different community elements (e.g., trees, benches, schools, roads, parks, etc.)</li>
        <li>Large sheets of paper or poster boards</li>
        <li>Markers, pens, and sticky notes for annotations</li>
        <li>A facilitator to guide discussions and structure the exercise</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the goal of picturization and how visual representations help in expressing community needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbol Selection:</strong> Participants choose from a variety of symbols to represent what they want or do not want in a community project.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement on Board:</strong> Participants place their selected symbols onto large sheets of paper, forming a visual layout of their ideal community space.</li>
        <li><strong>Annotations and Descriptions:</strong> Participants write brief explanations next to their symbols, detailing their choices and priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Discussion:</strong> Participants walk around, review each other’s picturization layouts, and engage in discussions about common themes and differences.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Round:</strong> The group comes together to synthesize insights and reflect on recurring patterns and unique perspectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Conclude with a discussion on how picturization can be applied to community engagement and participatory planning.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage creativity—participants can combine or modify symbols to better reflect their ideas.</li>
        <li>Ensure a relaxed and interactive atmosphere to promote open discussion.</li>
        <li>Use diverse visual elements to capture different aspects of community needs.</li>
        <li>Document and photograph the final picturization boards for future reference.</li>
    </ul>
