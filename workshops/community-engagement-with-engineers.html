    <h1>Community Engagement with Engineers Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop explores how engineers can engage with communities beyond technology.</p>
    
    <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A workshop topic (e.g., “How can engineers better engage with communities?”)</li>
        <li>A space with several small tables and chairs</li>
        <li>Paper or tablecloths to write on</li>
        <li>Markers or pens for everyone to use</li>
        <li>Snacks or drinks (optional, but fun!)</li>
        <li>Someone to be the facilitator (you!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick a Topic:</strong> Decide on the main question or theme for the workshop. For this session, the goal is to explore how engineers can look beyond technology and engage more effectively with communities. Key topics include:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding the role of history, community context, and structural considerations in technology systems.</li>
                <li>Developing listening skills for community engagement.</li>
                <li>Recognizing and navigating power dynamics in community interactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choose a Location:</strong> Find a comfortable location, like a large room or hall, with enough space to set up multiple small tables. Outdoor spaces can also work if the weather is nice.</li>
        <li><strong>Invite People:</strong> Invite a mix of engineering students, professionals, and community members who can provide diverse perspectives. Aim for groups of 4-5 participants per table.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up the Tables:</strong> Prepare the workshop area by setting up several small tables. Each table should have:
            <ul>
                <li>Paper or tablecloths for writing or drawing.</li>
                <li>Markers or pens for participants to use.</li>
                <li>Snacks or drinks to create a relaxed atmosphere.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Decide on a Facilitator:</strong> You (or someone else) will act as the facilitator to welcome participants, guide them through activities, and keep the workshop on track.</li>
        <li><strong>Explain the Rules:</strong> At the beginning, explain the workshop structure:
            <ul>
                <li>Participants will engage in moderator-led learning activities and a group project.</li>
                <li>Each activity focuses on specific learning objectives like listening, empowerment, and understanding technology’s broader impacts.</li>
                <li>Encourage creativity and active participation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Start the Activities:</strong> Begin the workshop with introductory and icebreaking activities to set the tone. Then, proceed through a series of activities designed to meet the learning objectives:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction and Icebreaking:</strong> Welcome participants and set expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Images of Community Development:</strong> Explore perceptions of “development” (focus on listening to communities).</li>
                <li><strong>Light Switch Game:</strong> Examine the systems behind a simple task like illuminating a room (focus on looking beyond technology).</li>
                <li><strong>Nano Around the World Card Game:</strong> Understand global inequities in nanotechnology (focus on looking beyond technology).</li>
                <li><strong>El Cajon Dam Case Study:</strong> Role-play to experience power dynamics in development (focus on empowering communities).</li>
                <li><strong>Ghanaian Village Case Study:</strong> Learn from a well-intentioned project with unintended outcomes (focus on listening and looking beyond technology).</li>
                <li><strong>Asking Questions:</strong> Practice asking questions to engage communities better (focus on listening).</li>
                <li><strong>Listening, Biases, and Communication:</strong> Practice active listening and identify personal biases.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Organize the Group Project:</strong> The core activity of the workshop is a group project where participants apply their knowledge to a community development problem. Steps include:
            <ul>
                <li>Listening to representatives from underserved communities discuss challenges and power dynamics.</li>
                <li>Forming teams of 3-5 participants to brainstorm an initial project plan that incorporates the principles of listening, empowerment, and looking beyond technology.</li>
                <li>Presenting these plans to the group for feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reflect and Wrap Up:</strong> At the end, bring everyone together to share key takeaways and discuss next steps. Encourage participants to reflect on the importance of community engagement and consider how they’ll apply these lessons in their work.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Bonus Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encourage Creativity:</strong> Allow participants to write, draw, or use other creative methods to share their ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Relaxed Atmosphere:</strong> Foster a friendly and collaborative environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Keep activities moving to maintain energy and engagement.</li>
    </ul>
