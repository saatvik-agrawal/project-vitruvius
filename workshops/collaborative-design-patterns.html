    <h1>Collaborative Design Patterns Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop engages participants in identifying, documenting, and applying collaborative design patterns to improve design processes and community-driven projects.</p>
    
    <h2>What Youâ€™ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A common theme or design challenge for participants to explore</li>
        <li>Large sheets of paper, whiteboards, or digital collaboration tools</li>
        <li>Markers, pens, and sticky notes for brainstorming</li>
        <li>Access to design pattern libraries or reference materials</li>
        <li>A facilitator to guide discussions and ensure structured collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the concept of collaborative design patterns and their application in design thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Challenges:</strong> Participants brainstorm key challenges within the chosen theme.</li>
        <li><strong>Documenting Existing Patterns:</strong> Participants analyze and document existing design solutions and structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating New Patterns:</strong> Teams collaborate to develop new patterns based on shared experiences and insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Applying Patterns:</strong> Participants apply their design patterns to hypothetical or real-world scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Groups present their developed design patterns, explaining their rationale and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Wrap up with a discussion on the impact and scalability of the patterns created.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration for diverse perspectives.</li>
        <li>Use real-world case studies to inspire innovative design solutions.</li>
        <li>Ensure all participants contribute ideas and insights.</li>
        <li>Document and share the developed design patterns for future reference.</li>
