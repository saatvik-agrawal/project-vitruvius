    <h1>Modeling Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop focuses on hands-on modeling techniques to explore design concepts, spatial arrangements, and structural relationships. Participants will engage in creative problem-solving through physical and digital modeling exercises.</p>
    
    <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Modeling materials (e.g., clay, foam, cardboard, 3D printing resources)</li>
        <li>Cutting tools, glue, and other assembly supplies</li>
        <li>Sketching materials for design planning</li>
        <li>Computers with 3D modeling software (optional)</li>
        <li>Facilitator to guide discussions and exercises</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the purpose of modeling and its applications in design and problem-solving.</li>
        <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> Participants brainstorm and sketch preliminary ideas before creating models.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> Discuss the properties of different modeling materials and choose appropriate ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-on Modeling:</strong> Participants build models individually or in groups, refining their designs as they progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation and Feedback:</strong> Groups present their models, discuss challenges, and receive constructive feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Conclude with a discussion on the effectiveness of modeling in visualizing concepts and problem-solving.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage iterative design—participants should refine their models based on feedback.</li>
        <li>Use a mix of physical and digital modeling tools for a comprehensive experience.</li>
        <li>Discuss real-world applications of modeling in engineering, architecture, and product design.</li>
    </ul>
