    <h1>Mapping Activity Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop helps participants visualize and analyze community spaces by mapping areas of importance, concern, and potential improvement. Mapping activities encourage discussion on spatial organization and community needs.</p>
    
    <h2>What Youâ€™ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large maps or printed layouts of the community or focus area</li>
        <li>Colored markers, pens, and sticky notes</li>
        <li>Reference materials for geographical or historical context</li>
        <li>Facilitator to guide discussions and coordinate mapping</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the purpose of the mapping activity and its role in community planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Defining Key Locations:</strong> Participants identify significant spaces such as landmarks, gathering areas, and neglected zones.</li>
        <li><strong>Marking Areas of Interest:</strong> Participants use markers and sticky notes to highlight areas they value, need improvement, or are underutilized.</li>
        <li><strong>Discussion and Analysis:</strong> Groups discuss their findings, identifying patterns, gaps, and opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposing Solutions:</strong> Participants brainstorm and document ideas for improving mapped areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Wrap up with a discussion on how mapping informs community planning and engagement.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage diverse perspectives by including various community members.</li>
        <li>Use different colors for mapping different elements (e.g., green for positive spaces, red for problem areas).</li>
        <li>Ensure an open and inclusive discussion environment.</li>
        <li>Document the final maps for future reference and action planning.</li>
    </ul>
