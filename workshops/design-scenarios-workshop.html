    <h1>Design Scenarios Workshop</h1>
    <p>This workshop engages participants in solving real-world design problems using structured case studies and collaborative problem-solving techniques.</p>
    
    <h2>What Youâ€™ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Case studies and design challenges relevant to the workshop theme</li>
        <li>Whiteboards, large sheets of paper, or digital collaboration tools</li>
        <li>Markers, pens, and sticky notes for brainstorming</li>
        <li>Facilitator to guide discussions and problem-solving exercises</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explain the purpose of design scenarios and their role in tackling real-world challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Presenting Challenges:</strong> Participants are introduced to a design scenario, detailing its constraints, stakeholders, and objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Mapping Solutions:</strong> Using provided case studies, participants analyze previous approaches and identify key takeaways.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Analysis and Ideation:</strong> Teams brainstorm possible solutions, leveraging past case studies and innovative thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping (Optional):</strong> If applicable, participants sketch or model their proposed solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Each group presents their design scenario solutions and receives feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Conclude with a discussion on how these methods can be applied in real-world design practice.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage participants to think critically and challenge assumptions.</li>
        <li>Use real-world case studies to provide practical context.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all participants contribute to group discussions.</li>
        <li>Document the process and solutions for future reference.</li>
    </ul>
