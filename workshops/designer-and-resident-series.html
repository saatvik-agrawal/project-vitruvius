    <h1>Designer and Resident Series of Workshops</h1>
    <p>This workshop series focuses on participatory design for housing, bringing together designers and residents to collaboratively develop living spaces that reflect community needs and values.</p>
    
    <h2>What Youâ€™ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A space where designers and residents can collaborate</li>
        <li>Sketching tools, whiteboards, or digital modeling software</li>
        <li>Printed materials with case studies and reference designs</li>
        <li>Facilitator to guide structured discussions and activities</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Workshop Series Structure</h2>
    <h3>1. Initial Exploration: Understanding Resident Needs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify key priorities and expectations for housing.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Resident discussions about daily routines and living conditions.</li>
                <li>Case studies on successful participatory housing projects.</li>
                <li>Sketching exercises to visualize personal housing needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Discovery Process: Ideation and Vision-Building</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop conceptual housing designs based on resident feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Brainstorming sessions to define shared values and themes.</li>
                <li>Group sketching of ideal housing layouts.</li>
                <li>Collaborative exercises to define spatial relationships and community spaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Prototyping: Creating Mockups and Models</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Translate ideas into tangible prototypes.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>3D modeling of proposed housing structures.</li>
                <li>Physical mockups using scale models.</li>
                <li>Resident feedback loops to refine designs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage open communication between designers and residents.</li>
        <li>Use real-world examples to inspire design thinking.</li>
        <li>Ensure iterative feedback to refine concepts at each stage.</li>
        <li>Document findings and proposals for future project implementation.</li>
    </ul>
